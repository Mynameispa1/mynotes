version control system/version controlling

The first thing we need to talk about version control system.

Version control system is nothing but we can manage multiple versions of our code. It will helps delevopers to track their chnages in there code.


centrolized repository and Distributed repository
-----------------------------------------
Centolized repository is nothing but it maintain only one repsoitory and if something happen with the centrolized repository, then it will be huge problem.

cvs and svn will comes under Centorilzed repository

Disrtibuted Repository is nothing but we can have multiple copy of the repository in localy. Even if the original repository is down, we still can have a copy of orginal repository. 

Git will comes under Distributed repository. It is a open source.

git commit -m "first commit" -----------> commit 

git remote add origin https://github.com/Mynameispa1/mytestrepopublic.git  ----------> add github repository to the local machine. It is nothing but your system has to know where the github is located.
